/* Question 3.1 - Three in One
    Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
 */

/* Notes
    Stack is LIFO, has to know push(item), pop, peek and isEmpty.

    An array can store a fixed number of elements of its type. To store more than one stack in one array, we either:
    - allocate a fixed amount of space for each stack (either pre-determined or equally divided between stacks),
    - allow the array to resize if one of the stacks run out of space.

    Basically, if we can keep track where one stack ends and the next begins, we can store multiple stacks in an array.
